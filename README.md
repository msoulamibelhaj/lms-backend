# VR-LMS Backend (Django + DRF + Channels)

A **Learning Management System (LMS) backend** built with **Django**, **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, and **Django Channels**, designed to power **VR classrooms on DPVR headsets**.  
It enables teachers to create and control lessons, synchronize playback across devices, and monitor student engagement in real time.  

---

## Features & Highlights

- **Multi-tenancy & Organization Support**  
  Manage multiple institutions (schools, organizations) in one platform.  

- **User & Device Binding**  
  Teachers and students log in using **nickname + 4-digit PIN**.  
  Devices (DPVR headsets) are bound by unique device IDs and linked to user accounts.  

- **Course / Class / Lesson Management**  
  Admin interface to create courses, modules, lessons, and schedule sessions.  
  Pre-installed VR lesson APKs can be triggered remotely.  

- **Real-Time Orchestration**  
  Teachers can push playback commands (play, pause, stop) to connected VR devices via WebSockets.  

- **Interaction Tracking & Monitoring**  
  Student devices send interaction events (gaze, clicks, actions) back to the backend.  
  Teacher dashboards can monitor what each student sees in real time.  

- **APIs**  
  REST endpoints (DRF) for resources like users, lessons, sessions, analytics.  
  WebSocket endpoints (Channels) for real-time synchronization.  

- **Admin / Staff Panel**  
  Django Admin for managing organizations, users, classes, lessons, device registrations, etc.

## ðŸ”Œ API & WebSocket Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/login/` â€” Login using **nickname + 4-digit PIN**

### Classes & Lessons
- `GET  /api/classes/` â€” List available classes
- `POST /api/session/addLesson/` â€” Add a lesson to a session

### Session Control
- `POST /api/session/create/` â€” Create a new session
- `POST /api/session/start/` â€” Start a session (teacher command)
- `POST /api/session/pause/` â€” Pause the current session
- `POST /api/session/stop/` â€” Stop the current session

### Progress & Results
- `GET  /api/results/` â€” Retrieve student progress/results

### Real-Time Communication
- `WS /websocket/` â€” WebSocket endpoint for real-time sync (teacher â†” students)
- `GET /index/` â€” Demo/test view (basic index page)


## Typical Workflow

Admin/Teacher sets up organizations, classes, lessons via Django Admin.

Students log in with nickname + PIN on DPVR devices (bound to device IDs).

Teacher starts a session, devices connect via WebSockets.

Teacher pushes playback commands to sync lessons across devices.

Studentsâ€™ interactions (gaze, clicks) are logged and monitored live.
